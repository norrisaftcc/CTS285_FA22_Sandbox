check vi's .gitignore -- did not have virtualenv or the database
(using a copy from cts285_sandbox but need to sync it -- get the schema)

rerunning the schema.sql step by step, recreated empty db.
next, add recipes.


now working out of cts285_sandbox/flasktutorial/TastyTable (officialy forked from vi's code)
removed /instance from .gitignore -- I get why it's done that way but I want it backed up.

/recipe/ doesn't work, and you would expect that since it renders template recipe/index.html which doesnt exist.
it should look like the blog index except that it reflects the recipe table columns (not yet the FK stuff)
127.0.0.1 - - [06/May/2023 18:16:17] "GET /recipe HTTP/1.1" 404 -
well, once you notice that the recipe blueprint was commented out of __init__.py it makes sense.
changed the sql call in recipe/ to match the current schema (minus the FKs other than user)

recipe/ now works. update the template and add a sample recipe to test it (after commit and push)
