check vi's .gitignore -- did not have virtualenv or the database
(using a copy from cts285_sandbox but need to sync it -- get the schema)

rerunning the schema.sql step by step, recreated empty db.
next, add recipes.

/recipe/ doesn't work, and you would expect that since it renders template recipe/index.html which doesnt exist.
