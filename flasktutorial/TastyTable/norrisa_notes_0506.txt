check vi's .gitignore -- did not have virtualenv or the database
(using a copy from cts285_sandbox but need to sync it -- get the schema)

rerunning the schema.sql step by step, recreated empty db.
next, add recipes.


now working out of cts285_sandbox/flasktutorial/TastyTable (officialy forked from vi's code)
removed /instance from .gitignore -- I get why it's done that way but I want it backed up.

/recipe/ doesn't work, and you would expect that since it renders template recipe/index.html which doesnt exist.
it should look like the blog index except that it reflects the recipe table columns (not yet the FK stuff)
127.0.0.1 - - [06/May/2023 18:16:17] "GET /recipe HTTP/1.1" 404 -
well, once you notice that the recipe blueprint was commented out of __init__.py it makes sense.
changed the sql call in recipe/ to match the current schema (minus the FKs other than user)

recipe/ now works. update the template and add a sample recipe to test it (after commit and push)

recipe

INSERT INTO recipe (author_id, title, body) VALUES (1, "boil water", "how to boil water");
as recipe id 1

INSERT INTO steps (recipe_id_fk, step_num, description)
VALUES (1, 1, "Heat water until it boils.");

INSERT INTO ingredients (type) VALUES ("water");

INSERT INTO recipe_ingredients(recipe_id_fk, ingredient_id_fk, quantity, measure_type)
VALUES (1, 2, 1, "cup");


# had to recreate recipe_ingredients as table is misspelled
CREATE TABLE "recipe_ingredients" (
	"recipe_id_fk"	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	"ingredient_id_fk"	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	"quantity"	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	"measure_type"	TEXT NOT NULL,
	FOREIGN KEY("recipe_id_fk") REFERENCES "recipe"("id")
);
# or i would but it didnt work... wait on it

INSERT INTO recipe_ingredents(recipe_id_fk, ingredent_id_fk, quantity, measure_type)
VALUES (1, 1, 1, "cup");

added /recipe/recipe.html which is rendered by /recipe/view/<int:id>
and it even shows up but as 
<sqlite3.Row object at 0x0000018D81D9BA70>

10pm
hacked it to just use a single string per ingredients, not a bridge table. that will suffice.

however, here's the chatgpt convo that almost worked:
