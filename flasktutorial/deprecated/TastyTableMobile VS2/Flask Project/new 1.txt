M7T1 - Graph Example


The general case for the "adventure" or "choice" data structure we've been describing is a graph.


In this program, we'll first get the example running, and then create a new graph (first as an image, then in code).





Part 1 - Example Graph


Image: 

 


Code: (repl link) https://replit.com/join/dvblmnfybg-ftccprogramming (source files) 
Graph.h
main.cpp
 


Part 2 - Student Graph


For this portion you will first create your own graph, then modify the program to implement that graph in C++.


You can get an image of the graph in a few ways:


Draw it by hand, and take a photo

Use a program like draw.io to create it

Ask an AI (LLM or image creator) to make it

Take an image (for example, from Google Maps) and highlight the vertexes and edges


You'll need to decide these things:


What are the nodes (vertexes) and how are they labeled (number, name, etc.)

What are the edges and how are they labeled (weight, direction, type, etc.)


If you change weights to a string, you'll need to modify Graph.h (we'll cover this in class).
