# CTS285_FA22_Sandbox
Sandbox containing test projects for CTS285 FA22

# Sample Projects (an idea of where we're headed)
To familiarize yourself with the design and use of text adventures, I recommend the following:
- Playing "The Cave of Magic DX" (about 5 minutes long): https://adventuron.itch.io/cavedx
- Skimming over the Tutorial A of Adventuron Classroom (which builds the Cave of Magic game): https://adventuron.io/documentation/tutorial-a.html

# Computer Science Concepts Involved 
- Data Structures: Arrays, Lists, Trees, and Nodes
  - Linked Lists (CS Dojo): https://youtu.be/WwfhLC16bis
- Design Patterns: Message, Command
  - (videos TBA)

# Projects
The goal of this repo is to offer starting points for the 285 FA22 class project. We'll start in Python and branch out as circumstances allow.

# Starting Points
- adventurelib [https://adventurelib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html] (basic messaging, commands, data storage)
- networkzero [https://networkzero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html] (communication between clients and client<->server)
- possible GUI libraries for those who want to go past basic text UI (libtcod AKA the Doryen library, pygamezero)

PyGameZero has a list of similar libraries at https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

# I don't want a text-only game...
OK. Dall-E-2 is now available to the public. Let it be your artist -- we'll cover how to include images once we have the basics set up.
