# CTS285_FA22_Sandbox
Sandbox containing test projects for CTS285 FA22

# Projects
The goal of this repo is to offer starting points for the 285 FA22 class project. We'll start in Python and branch out as circumstances allow.

# Starting Points
- adventurelib [https://adventurelib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html] (basic messaging, commands, data storage)
- networkzero [https://networkzero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html] (communication between clients and client<->server)
- possible GUI libraries for those who want to go past basic text UI (libtcod AKA the Doryen library, pygamezero)

PyGameZero has a list of similar libraries at https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
